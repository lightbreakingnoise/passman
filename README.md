# PassMan

the passman is written in python3 and it is not working with python2



you can get the passman on Linux

'git clone https://github.com/lordcodingsound/passman'

and you can run it with

'python3 passman.py'



if it fails you may need to install colorama

'sudo python3 -m pip install colorama'


if that fails too you may need to install python3-pip first

'sudo apt-get install python3-pip'
