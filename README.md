# PassMan
the passman is written in python3 and it is not working with python2

you can get the passman on Linux
```
git clone https://github.com/lordcodingsound/passman
```
and you can run it with
```
python3 passman.py
```

if you need help enter help inside the passman


if it fails you may need to install colorama
```
sudo python3 -m pip install colorama
```

if that fails too you may need to install python3-pip first (on Ubuntu/Debian)
```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```
